# Work Day Scheduler

The work day scheduler displays the current day of the week and date at the top.

There is a schedule with one hour blocks from 9 am to 5 pm. The user can type their tasks and save them.
The tasks blocks change color depending on the time of day and if it is the past, present or future.
